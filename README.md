   This is my password generator! This is a simple application that is able to generate a password based on the characteristics your desire your password to have. 
   If you would like your password to have all numbers (1,2,3,4,5), or if you would like your password to contain all symbols (!,@,#,$,%). 
   There is also an option to have your password contain generic letters of the alphabet with the option to distinctly choose to have all uppercase characters or all lowercase characters. 
   If you feel as if you need the highest level of security for your password you are able to select all of the options mention above! 

   Whether you're looking for the strongest password or simply just a new password, this application has everything you need.
